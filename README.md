# SPARSE: Staged Partitioned Architecture Search with Sub-Neural Dimensional Evaluation

Welcome to the **SPARSE Protocol**, an experimental framework for developing intelligent neural structures through gated training, dimensional injection, and emergent behavior evaluation across distributed simulations.

## ðŸ§  Overview

**SPARSE** (Staged Partitioned Architecture Search with Sub-Neural Dimensional Evaluation) is a novel AI experiment protocol structured into three key partitions:

1. **Partition 1**: Learns cube placement via layer-wise Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and gradient-based training.
2. **Partition 2**: Optimizes cube linking and connection accuracy.
3. **Partition 3**: After achieving stability in Partitions 1 & 2 (ADHD accuracy â‰¥ 95%), randomly injects sub-networks into neurons and evaluates emergent behavior across 27 planet-scale environments.

The goal is **emergent generalization**â€”enabling a cube-based construct (e.g., an AI "dog") to adapt and navigate checkpoints across diverse terrains and physics.

This flowchart details the progression through partitions, dimensional injection, and behavior evaluation across 20 permutations and 27 planets.

## ðŸ”¬ Components

| Component                  | Description                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ADHD Metrics**           | Custom gating metric based on deviation and emergent fitness (Partitions 1 & 2). |
| **Layer-wise NAS**         | Evolves architecture layer by layer, trained for one epoch before evaluation.    |
| **Sub-Neural Injection**   | Appends layers inside neurons in Partition 3, evaluated without training.        |
| **BioFoundry Environment** | 27 planets with unique rotation, gravity, and terrain.                           |
| **Permutation Engine**     | Tests 20 randomized sub-network variants per model for generalization.           |

## ðŸŒŒ Emergence Philosophy

SPARSE prioritizes emergent intelligence over handcrafted solutions:

- No supervision in Partition 3.
- No reward shaping.
- No backpropagation beyond initial structure.
- Intelligence arises from architecture, environment, and movement.

The first roll, twitch, or leap emerges purely from structure and mutation.

## ðŸš€ Next Phase: GENESIS (Meta-Generalization)

SPARSE outputs will feed into **GENESIS**, a higher-order model that:

- Generalizes across SPARSE runs.
- Synthesizes hybrid architectures.
- Builds adaptable neural controllers from evolutionary fragments.
